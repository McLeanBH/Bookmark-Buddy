# Bookmark-buddy

Bookmark Buddy is a bookmarking application, similar to that of http://www.pinboard.in; however, for the designated bookmark, there is a description, summary, or synonpsis of why the bookmark is relevant associated with it. Using Ember CLI & the Ember.js framework, it allows you to create, read, update, and delete the bookmarks and associated content, and provides the user with website oragnization, as well a means for remembering why he/she decided to save the URL bookmarked.
